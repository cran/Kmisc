Version 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Added some useful string operations: str_rev() and str_slice(). These
    functions are written in C for fast execution.

    names matching / not-matching the RE supplied are returned
  * Fixed bug with HTML tag functions handling of functions at arguments
  * Functions no longer depend on Rcpp - may be reintroduced in future
  * Minor changes to code for R <2.15.0 compatibility
  * Updated documentation + DESCRIPTION for clarity
  * Package now byte compiles by default

    used HTML functions (ie, they do not mask any base package functions)
