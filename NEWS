Version 0.4.0
------------------------------------------------------------
  * Package now requires Rcpp.
  * 'factor_to_char' now has a fast C implementation
  * Added 'split_runs', an Rcpp function for splitting a 
    numeric or character vector by the runs observed.
  * Made an Rcpp implementation of 'stack_list', for fast 
    stacking of lists of data.frames.
  * Fixed bug in 'swap' function.
  * Added 'grid.text2', a function that generates text with
    a simple background. Useful for overlaying simple 
    formulas / results on a plot.
  * Fixed bugs with 'kMerge'.

Version 0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fixed compatibility issues with old versions of R (no 
    calls to paste0()).
  * Added str_rev2(), for reversing of UTF-8 strings 
    (str_rev() remains for speed reasons when using 
    ASCII characters). Similarily with str_slice()
    and str_slice2().
  * Added str_sort(), a function for sorting a (UTF-8) 
    string lexically.
  * Updated documentation on extract() / without().
  * Improved error checking in extract() / without() - now 
    ensures that the symbols passed to ... are atomic
  * Added extract_rows.re() and without_rows.re() for 
    extracting rows from a dataframe whereby some variable 
    in the data frame (default: rownames) matches a regex 
    pattern
  * Added anat() / anatomy() functions for fast str()-like 
    calling on large data.frames
  * Added clean_doc(), a helper function that deletes all 
    documentation in the current working directory - used 
    for cleaning up orphaned docs, assuming you're 
    writing documentation with roxygen2
  * Added is.sorted(), which is really just !is.unsorted() 
    but seems the more 'logical' question in many cases
  * Added 'rcpp_apply_generator', a function for generating
    fast apply-type functions through Rcpp

Version 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------
  * Added some useful string operations: str_rev() and 
    str_slice(). These functions are written in C for fast 
    execution.
  * Added in.interval(), a function for checking whether 
    each element of a vector x lies within an interval 
    [lo, hi).
  * Added extract.re(), without.re() for extracting named 
    objects; objects with names matching / not-matching 
    the RE supplied are returned
  * Fixed bug with HTML tag functions handling of functions 
    as arguments
  * Functions no longer depend on Rcpp - may be 
    reintroduced in future
  * Minor changes to code for R <2.15.0 compatibility
  * Updated documentation + DESCRIPTION for clarity
  * Package now byte compiles by default
  * Introduced attachHTML(), detachHTML() functions for 
    attaching commonly used HTML functions (ie, they 
    do not mask any base package functions)
  * Exported makeHTMLTag() function, added documentation + 
    examples
  * Fixed bug in read.cb() for Mac systems
  * Added scan.cb(), for getting non-tabular data from 
    clipboard
