  \item{x}{A vector of p-values; numbers within the range 0
  to 1.}

  \item{...}{Optional arguments passed to

  is used for generating the plot and hence you shouldn't
  try to generate your own panel function.}
}

This function constructs a probability-probability plot as
based on a vector of p-values.
