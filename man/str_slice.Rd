\title{Slice a Vector at Consecutive Indices}
\usage{
str_slice(x, n = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a character vector.}

  \item{n}{integer (or numeric coercible to integer); index
  at which to slice.}
}
\value{
A list of length equal to the length of \code{x}, with each
element made up of the substrings generated from
\code{x[i]}.
}
\description{
This function 'slices' the strings of a character vector
\code{x} at consecutive indices \code{n}, thereby
generating consecutive substrings of length \code{n} and
returning the result as a list. Not safe for use with
unicode characters.
}
\note{
Underlying code is written in C for fast execution.

x <- c("ABCD", "EFGH", "IJKLMN")
