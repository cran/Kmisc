\usage{
any_na(x, how = "unlist")
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An \R object.}

  \item{how}{The simplification to use if \code{x} is a
  list. See \code{\link{rapply}} for more details.}
}
\description{
This function checks whether there are any missing values
in an \R object. For list objects, we recurse over each
entry. This is typically faster than \code{any(is.na(x))}
as we exit and return \code{TRUE} as soon as an \code{NA}
is discovered.
